# Weather App

A web application built with **Node.js** and **REST** API. The app fetches the lat/lan coordinates of user-input location from **Mapbox** geocoding API,
and uses those coordinates to forecast weather data from the **darksky.net** weather API(requires API authentication).
It uses **MongoDB** **NoSQL** database for data store, parse and manipulation.
